Scripts and data files corresponding to the manuscript "**Global genome diversity of the Leishmania donovani complex**".

The manuscript is published in eLife and avaiable at https://elifesciences.org/articles/51243 and the previous version is avavilable on bioRxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/710145v1.

The directories with the respective analysis scripts are organised by topic. Each folder contains the respective analysis scripts and a README file. Sometimes results directories and corresponding (intermediate) results files that can be calculated with the analysis scripts are already provided in the respective folder. This is typically done when the respective (intermediate) results are also required as input for another analysis in a different directory. Other data files or example data are also provided in the "data" directory. Note: Some files have to be unzipped before usage.
